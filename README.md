## Description

The motivation behind this project was allow for better way to create passwords. With a password generator, one would spend less time having to come up with password and would have a place to easily and efficiently retrieve randomized passwords. This is meant to help users take the stress out of creating passwords that meet all qualifications by simply following the prompts that are asked.

## Usage 

The password generator is an easy and quick tool to run through.  Users must begin by clicking the “Generate Password” button which will be followed by a series of prompts. The following prompts contain questions such as “would you like to use uppercase characters?” or “special characters?” If no valid answer is given user will be asked to provide  a valid entry. After the short series of questions the generator will provide a randomized password characters that user agreed to use.

## Learning Points
Through this projects process I realized just how many ways one can go about creating the javascript function, as well as how much work goes into something as small as pop-up prompts.
